Today we deployed the Heroku web interface. If you have the [Heroku add-on](http://addons.heroku.com/redistogo)
go ahead and check it out and let us know your feedback! Primarily this will
give you access to all of the backup data. We will be adding some more information
about the status of your instance in the future.
