Several request have come in asking about a API for provisioning a
[Redis](http://redis.io) instance. In response we have opened up our [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)
API. You can find more information in our [docs](http://redistogo.com/documentation/api).

Enjoy!
