[Redis To Go](http://redistogo.com) launched is first Redis instance in August
of last year as a part of the [Heroku](http://heroku.com) add-on platform and
it is still running! Starting next month (Feb. 1st) the site (redistogo.com)
will be open for use independent of the Heroku platform.

Many of you have been using the service free of charge for the past few months,
next month we will begin charging for paid plans.

- nano: free
- mini: $5 / month
- small: $20 / month
- medium: $110 / month
- large: $300 / month
- super: $1000 / month
- mega: $4000 / month

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at james@redistogo.com.

Our system has been with Heroku for a few months and we are looking forward to
both growing the system and providing the same level of service as we do for
Heroku.
