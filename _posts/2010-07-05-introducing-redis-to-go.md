[Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/), an advanced key-value store, has
recently seen major uptake. Think of Redis as a database
for data-structures. The ability to store different data-structures 
gives Redis strength and flexibility. After discovering Redis, I find
myself using it in nearly all of my projects.

With every project I have done using Redis, I've been aggravated when adding a
new server to manage. Setting up a server can be daunting, and adds one more
part to juggle. My time was not spent on the projects themselves, but felt
tediously wasted on managing the system. What happens if the server goes down?
How do I make sure Redis is up and running? Where do I backup my data and how
do I do it?

This madness ends today! [Redis To Go](http://redistogo.com/) answers all of
these problems. In under a minute, a new Redis server is ready for use. Now,
using Redis in any project is dead simple.

Redis To Go is currently offered as an add-on to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/).
The Heroku platform is robust and powerful â€“ a potent combination of
simplicity and power. Heroku has a vision for keeping deployment pain-free, a
vision Redis To Go is proud to expand. With once click, you can add Redis to
your application. Deploying web applications has never been easier.

Don't use Heroku? Don't worry. In the coming weeks, we will add the ability to
provision Redis directly from the [Redis To Go](http://redistogo.com/)
website. 

If you are interested in either the Heroku beta program or the Redis To
Go website alpha, please fill out this [form](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dFZfTmZ1YWJpRzdSb3V1Wl9QaWVqcWc6MQ).

I am excited about this service and would love your feedback and questions.
