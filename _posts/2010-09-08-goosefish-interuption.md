On Monday, Sept 6 the `goosefish` server became unresponsive. Not only were
any instances hosted on the server unavailable, ssh access was also unavailable.
The server was restarted and each Redis instance brought back online.

At over half an hour it was an unacceptable recovery time. We are building the
tools necessary to automate the recovery process.

During this time it became apparent that our support process was not clearly
defined. We post updates about our current status on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/redistogo). This is the first place any
notifications will get posted.

In the coming days we will be launch a more formal support process at
http://redistogo.com/support. Most importantly this will contain a phone
number to contact if you are experiencing issues.

If you have any question please contact me at james@redistogo.com. We
are terribly sorry for the issue that occurred.
